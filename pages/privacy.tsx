          <p>
            Baabar (&ldquo;we&ldquo;, or &ldquo;us&ldquo;) values your trust and
            a key part of earning your trust is being upfront and clear in how
            we gather and use your information. We created this Policy to inform
            you on what data we collect, how we collect your data, how we share
            your data, and your rights around the data. This Policy applies when
            you use our services available through Baabar (&ldquo;Site&ldquo;).
            For the purposes of this Policy, the Site, features, content,
            applications, and other services provided by Baabar will be referred
            to as the &ldquo;Services&ldquo;. This Policy works in conjunction
            with the Site&apos;s Terms of Use. Any capitalized terms used, but
            not defined, in this Policy have the meanings provided in the Terms
            of Use. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please

          <h3>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h3>
          <p>
            We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which pages
            you viewed. Some 3rd parties like ad networks may know you visited
            this website. We never share your data with 3rd parties except to
            help us deliver our services. These are the key points, if you need
            detail, keep reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Google Analytics</span> : We measure visitors to our website
            using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our
            site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about
            your computer. All of that information is anonymous. So we
            don&apos;t know who you are, just that somebody visited our site.
            The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what
            parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and
            so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our
            website better. Please see here{" "}

            <span>Create a Baabar short Link</span> : By using our Services,
            Users can create shortened URLs of websites. Users can create
            Shortened Links totally for free. When you create a Short Link using
            Baabar, Baabar collects and stores the original URL and the
            shortened URL and stores it in a database.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Scanning QR Codes</span> : We do not collect, transmit or
            store any data from QR Codes you scan using our Services. Scanning
            happens completely locally in your browser.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Generating QR Codes</span> : QR codes you create with our
            Baabar directly encode all content directly in the image itself. We
            do not collect, transmit or store any information you enter. The
            Code is generated directly in the browser without transmiting any
            information to a remote system (that&spos;s why it also works
            offline by the way).
          </p>
