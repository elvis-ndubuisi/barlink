# Benefits of Using URL Shorteners

Long and complex URLs are cumbersome to share online and require the use of link shortening services. It's worth noting that the length of a URL and the number of characters displayed greatly affect the credibility of that URL.

Of course, not all URLs are so complicated. Nevertheless, many links are often long for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) reasons. SEO is about improving your ranking on search engines, especially Google. One of the important factors that Google and other search engines consider is the keywords in the URL. URLs help describe the content of the page, making it difficult for users to use minified URLs. Long links are difficult to share via email or social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.

## Why use a URL Shorteniing service like Barlink?

- **Convenience**: It's much easier to share short links than it is to share long and complicated links. This is especially important if your viewer can't physically click the link or if you're promoting your site one-on-one with a client. If you're doing a PowerPoint presentation or sharing direct links with prospects, URL shortening services can help you create short, easy-to-remember links that you can type directly into your smartphone or web browser.
- **Ability to track performance**: One of the main benefits of URL shortening services is that you can track clicks on every link you share. Depending on the service you use to compress your web links, you may be able to see a breakdown of your visitors by demographics such as country and gender. You can also see which social channels and posts are getting the most clicks.
- **Increases engagement**: Your audience is more likely to engage with a shortened URL, especially if itâ€™s recognizably associated with a known brand. We are used to seeing shortened URLs on social media. As a result, shorter links improve click-through rates. This is one of the easiest changes you can make to your posting strategy to improve its effectiveness.
  **Professionalism**: Your audience is probably used to seeing shared content in the form of shortened links. In fact, this method is so common that you may find yourself sharing uncompressed URLs. Long URLs can look sloppy and messy to viewers accustomed to clearer, shorter links.
